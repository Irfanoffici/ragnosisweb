# Cardiovascular Diseases
Hypertension: Also known as high blood pressure, is a condition where the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. Stage 1 hypertension is 130-139/80-89 mmHg. Risk factors include family history, obesity, and high salt intake. Treatment involves lifestyle modifications and medications like ACE inhibitors or diuretics.

Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: A metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin. Symptoms include increased thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), increased hunger (polyphagia), and blurred vision. Long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Management includes diet, exercise, metformin, and possibly insulin therapy.

Influenza: An acute viral infection of the respiratory tract. Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat, and runny nose. The cough can be severe and can last 2 or more weeks. Annual vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection.

Asthma: A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Treatment involves bronchodilators for quick relief and inhaled corticosteroids for long-term control.

Migraine: A primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. Preventive medications include beta blockers and anticonvulsants.

2. Symptoms & Signs
•	Seizures (generalized or focal), with or without convulsions.
•	Confusion, loss of consciousness, aura (before seizure), twitching.
3. Diagnosis
•	EEG (electroencephalogram), brain MRI/CT.
•	Blood tests to rule out metabolic causes.
4. Treatment & Management
•	Antiepileptic drugs (e.g., valproate, carbamazepine).
•	Surgery or vagus nerve stimulation in refractory cases.
•	Lifestyle: Avoid triggers (sleep deprivation, alcohol).
5. Prevention
•	Prevent head injuries, manage infections, prenatal care.
•	Medication compliance to prevent recurrence.

25. Osteoarthritis
1. Classification & Causes
•	Classification: Degenerative joint disease (non-inflammatory).
•	Causes: Aging, joint wear-and-tear, obesity, joint injuries.
2. Symptoms & Signs
•	Joint pain, stiffness (worse with activity), decreased mobility, bony swelling, crepitus.
•	Common in knees, hips, hands, spine.
3. Diagnosis
•	Clinical exam + imaging (X-rays show joint space narrowing, osteophytes).
•	Rule out inflammatory arthritis with blood tests (normal in OA).
4. Treatment & Management
•	Weight loss, physical therapy.
•	Pain management: NSAIDs, acetaminophen.
•	Intra-articular steroids, joint replacement surgery in advanced cases.
5. Prevention
•	Maintain healthy weight.
•	Avoid joint overuse/injury.
•	Stay active with joint-friendly exercises.

26. Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)
1. Classification & Causes
•	Classification: Formation of stones in the gallbladder.
•	Causes: Imbalance in cholesterol or bile salts. Risk factors: female, fat, fertile, forty (4 Fs), rapid weight loss, pregnancy.
2. Symptoms & Signs
•	Often asymptomatic.
•	Biliary colic: RUQ pain after fatty meal, radiating to back.
•	Nausea, vomiting. Complications: cholecystitis, jaundice, pancreatitis.
3. Diagnosis
•	Abdominal ultrasound is first-line.
•	LFTs, CT, MRCP if complications suspected.
4. Treatment & Management
•	Asymptomatic: usually no treatment.
•	Symptomatic: laparoscopic cholecystectomy (surgical removal).
•	Pain control, antibiotics if infection.
5. Prevention
•	Maintain healthy weight, avoid crash diets.
•	Healthy low-fat diet.
•	Regular physical activity.

27. Meningitis
1. Classification & Causes
•	Classification: Inflammation of the meninges (brain/spinal cord coverings).
•	Causes:
o	Bacterial (e.g., Neisseria meningitidis, Strep. pneumoniae) – severe.
o	Viral – more common and milder.
o	Fungal, parasitic in immunocompromised.
2. Symptoms & Signs
•	High fever, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, photophobia.
•	Altered mental status, seizures in severe cases.
•	In infants: bulging fontanelle, poor feeding.
3. Diagnosis
•	Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis (essential).
•	Blood cultures, CT scan before LP if needed.
4. Treatment & Management
•	Bacterial: Urgent IV antibiotics and corticosteroids.
•	Viral: Supportive care.
•	Isolation in some types (e.g., meningococcal).
5. Prevention
•	Vaccination (Hib, meningococcal, pneumococcal).
•	Prophylactic antibiotics for close contacts.
•	Prompt treatment of infections (e.g., ear/sinus infections).
28. Pneumonia
1. Classification & Causes
•	Classification: Acute lower respiratory infection.
•	Cause: Bacterial (Strep. pneumoniae), viral (influenza, RSV), fungal (rare). Hospital vs. community-acquired.
2. Symptoms & Signs
•	Fever, cough with sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain.
•	Crackles on chest auscultation.
3. Diagnosis
•	Chest X-ray, sputum culture, blood tests, oxygen saturation.
4. Treatment & Management
•	Antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, macrolides), antivirals if viral.
•	Supportive care: fluids, oxygen.
•	Hospitalization if severe.
5. Prevention
•	Pneumococcal and flu vaccines.
•	Smoking cessation.
•	Good hygiene and handwashing.
29. Gout
1. Classification & Causes
•	Classification: Inflammatory arthritis due to uric acid crystal deposition.
•	Cause: Hyperuricemia from diet, alcohol, renal impairment, or genetic factors.
2. Symptoms & Signs
•	Sudden, intense joint pain (often big toe).
•	Swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness.
•	Recurrent attacks may affect multiple joints.
3. Diagnosis
•	Joint fluid aspiration shows urate crystals.
•	Serum uric acid levels (may be normal during attack).
•	X-rays for chronic disease.
4. Treatment & Management
•	NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids for acute attacks.
•	Long-term: allopurinol, febuxostat to lower uric acid.
•	Lifestyle changes: limit alcohol, red meat, sugary drinks.
5. Prevention
•	Avoid triggers (diet, alcohol).
•	Maintain healthy weight.
•	Regular use of uric acid-lowering therapy in chronic gout.

30. Polio (Poliomyelitis)
1. Classification & Causes
•	Classification: Viral disease affecting the nervous system.
•	Cause: Poliovirus, spread via fecal-oral route.
2. Symptoms & Signs
•	Mostly asymptomatic.
•	Mild: fever, fatigue, sore throat.
•	Severe: paralysis, muscle weakness, respiratory failure.
3. Diagnosis
•	Stool or throat culture for virus isolation.
•	PCR for poliovirus RNA.
4. Treatment & Management
•	No cure — supportive care.
•	Physical therapy for muscle weakness.
•	Ventilatory support if respiratory muscles involved.
5. Prevention
•	Vaccination: OPV (oral) or IPV (inactivated).
