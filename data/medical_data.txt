# Cardiovascular Diseases
Hypertension: Also known as high blood pressure, is a condition where the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. Stage 1 hypertension is 130-139/80-89 mmHg. Risk factors include family history, obesity, and high salt intake. Treatment involves lifestyle modifications and medications like ACE inhibitors or diuretics.

Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: A metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin. Symptoms include increased thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), increased hunger (polyphagia), and blurred vision. Long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Management includes diet, exercise, metformin, and possibly insulin therapy.

Influenza: An acute viral infection of the respiratory tract. Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat, and runny nose. The cough can be severe and can last 2 or more weeks. Annual vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection.

Asthma: A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Treatment involves bronchodilators for quick relief and inhaled corticosteroids for long-term control.

Migraine: A primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. Preventive medications include beta blockers and anticonvulsants.
